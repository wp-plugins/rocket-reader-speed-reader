== Description ==

= Introduction =
This plugin allows the visitor to read the content of a WordPress web page / post, using the 'Rocket Reader'

It's a nifty Speed-Reading plugin. Using the Rocket Reader you can decrease the reading time of an article by, maybe, as much as 80%!

The key is to reduce the eye movement while reading.
In the traditional way of reading, your eyes are constantly moving left to right, and back, loosing precious time (and it's very tiring too!).

This plugin is presenting the words one by one and it uses a focal point (also called Optical Recognition Point, ORP).
Research proved that your eyes are always looking for a specific point within a word for faster recognition of the pattern.
So by highlighting that focal point it makes reading even way faster!

= Settings =
You can find the settings page in the WP Admin Panel &raquo; Settings &raquo; Rocket Reader Opts.
